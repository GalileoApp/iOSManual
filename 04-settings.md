# Settings

> Guru Maps is available in a ready-to-use state and app settings should be considered as an optional and more advanced way of using the App. Settings let you configure app options, purchase additional features and manage routing geo data representation.

## Vector Maps Settings {#VectorMapsSettings}

### Font and Language {#FontAndLanguage}

#### Font size

You can configure Guru to display all text on a vector map at various font size. To increase, decrease, or change the default font size, go to app Settings &gt; Font and Languages:

#### Preferred language order

In some regions, objects on the map in addition to local names have names in other languages. The map will show the names of the user designated the first language in this list if it has been defined by the user. This feature may be useful for multilingual countries, such as Belgium where Dutch, French and German share official language status.

Tap **Edit** button on the top right of the screen, to rearrange or delete languages from the list:

<img src="/assets/route_options_2.png" width="375"/>

<img src="/assets/route_options_3.png" width="375"/>


#### Use navigation online

<img src="/assets/navigation_mode.png" width="375"/>



#### Voice instructions {#voiceSettings}
 
The default language for voice instructions you hear while navigating a route depends on the language your device is set to use.  
To change the language, select one from the Voice Instructions list:

**Note**: as the App uses text-to-speech \(TTS\) engine instead of pre-recorded audio, correct pronunciation depends on the TTS engine.

**Tip**: If you connect your iOS device to the Bluetooth-capable stereo system in a car, you will hear voice instructions over your car speakers.

#### Auto-record track during navigation

Enable "Auto-record track during navigation" option to save the finished routes automatically as GPS tracks to your collections.
You can also choose where recorded routes are stored in your collections.

## Synchronization {#sync}

Guru app allows you to synchronize all your data to make your collections visible and available through all your iOS devices using your Facebook or iCloud account.

App uses Facebook/iCloud login only can be done, this does not let the Guru post or share your data.

To enable the synchronization feature, go to the app Settings > Sync and select the desired synchronizing option. Use the same login on all your devices to keep the data synchronized.

## Data Backup {#dataBackup}

Backing up data is a great way to minimize accidental data loss and restore the most important geodata on your iOS device.

#### Create backup

Tap **Back Up My Collections** button on Settings &gt; Data Backup screen to backup the collections within the App.  
When the backup finished successfully, you'll see the name of the device along with the date and time the backup was created:

<img src="/assets/data_backup.png" width="359" height="306" />

**Note**: Created backup only includes data from My Collections (bookmarks and GPS tracks), and it doesn't include downloaded and cached tiles.

#### Save backup

Backups are stored on your device and will be removed automatically when the App is removed. To prevent data loss, we recommend that you backup regularly.

The best way to keep your backups available across all your iOS devices is to use the Files App. Within the Files App you can set up your other cloud services as well \(Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Drive, etc\).

To save the backup, tap the ![](/assets/icon_share.png) icon, then select Save to Files option.

<img src="/assets/data_backup_share.png" width="360" height="640" />

#### Restore from a backup

Tap the backup you created earlier in the list on the Data Backup screen to restore, or select .gbackup2 file from the Files app or from other cloud service \(e.g. in Dropbox app\), then tap the ![](/assets/icon_export.png) icon and select **Copy to Guru Maps** option.

<img src="/assets/data_backup_restore.png" width="360" height="640" />

**Note**: Restoring from backup will remove all current bookmarks and GPS tracks in My Collections.
