# Features

> In this article we will show some distinguishing features, that will make your Galileo experience easier and more complete.

## Search {#search}

The App lets you search within [My Collections](02-features.md#collections) content as well as the vector map data within OpenStreetMap.  
To open the search screen, tap the ![](/assets/icon_serach.png) search button. Type or paste the keyword you want to find in the search field, then tap **Done** on the keyboard.  
Search results will be displayed on the map and in the list below the search field. It is also possible to narrow down your search using the **Search around me** option at the bottom.  
Tap an any of the results in the list to open its entry or back to the map to overview them all. The search will be refined as you browse the map automatically and only results meeting the selected search criteria will be displayed on the visible area.

If search results are found, the search icon will be changed to the ![](/assets/icon_search_results.png). To reset search results, tap the clear ![](/assets/icon_cross.png) icon.

**Voice Search**: You can use your voice to perform search instead of typing when you're connected to the Internet. Just tap the search field, and then tap the microphone icon next to the spacebar on the iOS keyboard to start dictating. When you’re finished, tap **Done** and then wait for your words to be processed. It can take a few seconds for text to appear.

**Note**: The App makes searching within the downloaded offline maps and only places which are mapped within OpenStreetMap can be found and displayed.

Performing a search in the following ways allows you to search places fast and easy:

* by categories,  
* by name,
* by GPS coordinates,
* by address \(Internet connection require\).

### Search by category

There are predefined categories available on the screen for a quick search. Just tap the category icon \(food, accommodation, etc\) to list the matching results for a given category:

<img src="/assets/search_1.png" width="375" height="379" />

You can also narrow your search by entering the keyword after the category name as shown below:

<img src="/assets/search_2.png" width="374" height="423" />

### Search by name

Just start typing the name of the object \(POI\) you are looking for. As you type, you'll see a list of search results and suggestions:

<img src="/assets/search_3.png" width="375" height="378" />

**Tip**: It is not necessary to type punctuation or worry about capital letters, but the search will not recognize a misspelling.

### Search by GPS coordinates

If you know the exact coordinates of a location, you can simply enter them into the search field to locate it on the map:

<img src="/assets/search_4.png" width="375" height="223" />

Read also: [Units Format](03-settings.md#unitsFormat).

**Tip**: You may enter the coordinates in any of the supported coordinate formats. To avoid confusion while inputting coordinates from the keyboard it is possible to use spaces instead of \(‘\) Right Single Quotation Mark, \(”\) Right Double Quotation Mark or \(°\) Degree Sign.

### Search by address

Type city, zip or address of any location on the world map \(in that sequence with a comma as shown\). If there are no search results found within the downloaded maps, tap **Done** to perform a search **online**.

<img src="/assets/search_address_1.png" width="375" height="377" />

To get routed to the selected search result, swipe right on the cell in the list:

<img src="/assets/search_address_2.png" width="375" height="377" />

To view more address and contact information, tap the desired result in the list.

<img src="/assets/search_address_3.png" width="375" height="492" />

To save search result to your collections, tap ![](/assets/icon_save_to_collections.png) icon at the bottom of details screen.

## Navigation {#navigation}

Galileo Offline Maps gives you the ability to find the best route and get step by step directions for your drive or walk \(**Internet connection required**\).



#### Create route

To get started with the route planner feature, define the place you want to go first, long tap the destination point on the map, then tap ![](/assets/route_to_icon.png) icon from the pop up menu.

Alternatively:

* you can tap ![](/assets/route_to_icon.png) icon on the bottom line of the bookmark/POI/search results details screen
* swipe right on bookmark in My Collections or search results list, then tap.

A map will appear with your driving route highlighted in blue with some route information at the bottom:

* Distance to go
* Arrival time
* Time to go

<img src="/assets/navigation.png" width="375" height="667" />

Route will be shown for **drive** mode by default, but you may choose the appropriate mode for your needs:

<img src="/assets/route_set_2.png" width="375" height="64" />

To begin navigation, tap ![](/assets/play_icon.png) icon.  
To stop your route, tap ![](/assets/pause_button.png) icon, then **Stop movement** option from menu.  
If you miss a turn or intentionally go the wrong way from the planned route, the App will automatically recalculate the route \(**Internet connection required**\).

#### Edit route

To edit your route, tap ![](/assets/pause_button.png)  icon, then **Edit route** option from menu. It is possible to add additional transit points \(also known as waypoints\) or stops to the route by a long tap on the map for each you want to add:

<img src="/assets/route_editing_1.png" width="293" height="61" />

These signs will appear on the map along your route:

![](/assets/transit_point.png) — for transit points, ![](/assets/stop_point.png) — for stop points.

To edit or delete the point, just tap it on the map to bring up the pop-up menu:

<img src="/assets/route_editing_2.png" width="228" height="79" />

#### Voice instructions

When you’re navigating to a place, you can hear navigation directions. You can stop receiving directions at any time while in navigation mode by tapping the sound icon ![](/assets/sound_icon.png).

A long tap on the sound icon allows to choose one of the supported languages, which will be used for voice instructions. You can also change the language selection to hear the navigation instructions in the app Settings &gt; Navigation.

**Tip**: If you pair your iOS device with your Bluetooth capable device so you can stream voice instructions from the Galileo app to your Helmet device or automobile speaker system. How it works: when listening to music the voice instructions would lower the music volume automatically and give directions and then would automatically go back to the normal volume of the mucis once voice instructions finished.
