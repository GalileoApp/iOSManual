# Features

> In this article we will show some distinguishing features, that will make your Guru Maps experience easier and more complete.

## Download Maps {#download}

#### Download maps and navigation data

Free vector maps by country are available for download within the Guru Maps in the app settings menu called **Download Maps**.

<img src="/assets/download_map_3.png" width="375" />

Tap the country name to expand the list of available options:
* Download a map,
* Download a navigation data (if you whant to use navigation while being offline).


To pause a download, tap the cell. Tap it again to resume a download.


To remove the map or navigation data, swipe your finger across the cell from right to left, then tap the **Delete** button, or use the **Edit** button at the top right corner.


#### Update maps and navigation data

As OpenStreetMap data is constantly updated by thousands of volunteers around the world, so map updates are available from time to time within the app. In the Guru Maps app all vector map updates are free and distributed automatically. If there is an update for a previously downloaded map, you will see the **Update** button beside the map.

To update all your downloaded maps, tap the **Update All** button.

#### Share maps and navigation data

It's possible to use AirDrop to share downloaded vector maps and offline navigation data between iOS devices that are nearby when you are without an Internet connection.

## Search {#search}

Guru allows to search within the downloaded vector maps by name, by categories, by address and by GPS coordinates.

All types of searches are completely offline and require only the vector maps to be downloaded. The object will be found in Guru Maps if it exists on OpenStreetMap.org.

Note: to search for your data such as bookmarks and GPS tracks, open the [My Collections](03-settings.md#collections).

#### Start search

To open the search screen, tap the magnifying-glass ![](/assets/icon_serach.png) icon. Type or paste the keyword you want to find in the search field, then tap **Find** on the keyboard.  

You can also use your voice to perform a search instead of typing when you're connected to the Internet. Just tap the search field, and then tap the microphone ![](/assets/icon_mic.png) icon next to the spacebar on the iOS keyboard to start dictating. When you’re finished, tap **Done** and then wait for your words to be processed. It can take a few seconds for text to appear.

#### Search suggestions

Quick search mechanism designed to make it faster to complete your searches. Just begin typing, and you’ll see the
suggested results appear:

<img src="/assets/search_quick_suggest.png" width="375" />

If nothing of these quick suggestions matches your query, then tap **Find** on the keyboard to get the full list of results.

#### History
Below the category icons you’ll see a list of search queries with a clock icon on the left. We show these to help you quickly get back to a previous search you may have conducted.

<img src="/assets/search_history.png" width="375" />

#### Results on the map

Search results will appear on the map in addition to the scrollable list below. Map preview is interactive and search results are refreshed on the fly as you move and scale the map.

<img src="/assets/search_results_list.png" width="375" />

Tap any result on the map or in the list to get more information in details view below. Tap it again on the map to come back to all search results list again. 

<img src="/assets/search_results_details.png" width="375" />

After you find a place, you can view it on the map, get directions to this place or save as bookmarks in your collections:

<img src="/assets/search_results_actions.png" width="375" />


#### Search by name

It is not necessary to type punctuation or worry about capital letters, but the search will not recognize a misspelling.


#### Search by category
You can also search for a category, like food or shops:

<img src="/assets/search_categories.png" width="375" />

At the top of a search results for selected category, you can see ways to narrow down your results:

<img src="/assets/search_categories_filter.png" width="375" />

You can edit your search criteria to find exactly what you want. Just tap the search field and start typing to refine your search:

<img src="/assets/search_categories_refine.png" width="375" />


#### Search by address

Start typing the street name, and Guru starts offering matching entries, choose one you want:

<img src="/assets/search_address.png" width="375" />

Then Guru displays a list of all house numbers on the street:

<img src="/assets/search_address_2.png" width="375" />

Enter house numbers to narrow the selection:

<img src="/assets/search_address_3.png" width="375" />

### Search by coordinates

If you know the exact coordinates of a location, you can simply enter them into the search field to locate it on the map:

<img src="/assets/search_coordinates.png" width="375" />

You may enter the coordinates in any of the supported coordinate formats. To avoid confusion while inputting coordinates from the keyboard it is possible to use spaces instead of \(‘\) Right Single Quotation Mark, \(”\) Right Double Quotation Mark or \(°\) Degree Sign.

## Navigation {#navigation}

Guru Maps gives you the ability to find the best multi-stop route and get step by step directions for your drive or walk.

**Note:** to build a route offline you need to download navigation data first. 
Read also: [Download maps and navigation data](03-settings.md#download).

#### Create route

To get started with the route planner feature, define the place you want to go first, long tap the destination point on the map, then tap ![](/assets/route_to_icon.png) icon from the pop-up menu.

<img src="/assets/route_to_bookmark_2.png" width="375" /> 

Alternatively:

* you can tap ![](/assets/route_to_icon.png) icon on the bottom line of the bookmark/POI/search results in details screen:
<img src="/assets/route_to_bookmark_3.png" width="375" /> 
* swipe right on a bookmark in My Collections list, then tap ![](/assets/route_to_icon.png):
<img src="/assets/route_to_bookmark.png" width="375" /> 

A map will appear with your driving route highlighted in blue with some route information at the bottom: distance to go, time to go, arrival time:

<img src="/assets/route_set.png" width="375" /> 

Route will be shown for **drive** mode by default, but you may choose the appropriate mode for your needs:

<img src="/assets/route_set_2.png" width="375" />

If you choose cycle or pedestrian mode, a gradient will appear which shows an altitude during the route (**gradient will appear only if there is an internet connection**):

<img src="/assets/navigation_2.png" width="375" />

**Note:** the point on the track is related to the speed and altitude values.



#### Add waypoints

Waypoints are via locations, that you want to go through along your route before you reach your destination. There are two ways to add waypoints to a route:

* by tapping and holding on a location directly on the map:
<img src="/assets/waypoint_add_map.png" width="375"/>
* by tapping "+ Add waypoint" from the list and searching for the waypoint:
<img src="/assets/waypoint_add_list.png" width="375"/>


The route will be adjusted automatically after adding any waypoint. Once the route is calculated, you can drag and drop the waypoints on the map or reorder directly from the list to recalculate the route dynamically.

To remove the waypoint, tap it on the map:  

<img src="/assets/waypoint_remove_map.png" width="375"/>


The service error message "Path distance exceeds the max distance limit" will appear when the route is greater than the service limits:

**Cycling**

 • Online: 50 points or 400km 
 • Offline: 50 points or 200km

**Driving**

 • Online: 20 points or 5000km 
 • Offline: 20 points or 2000km

**Walking**

 • Online: 50 points or 100km 
 • Offline: 50 points or 100km


To save your route for later use, tap the 3-dots button in the top right corner and select **Save route** option from the menu.

To get a route with shortest travel time, tap the 3-dots button in the top right corner and select **Optimize route** option from the menu.

**Note**: created route does not take in account the real-time or historical traffic data.

#### Navigation mode


To begin navigation, tap ![](/assets/route_start.png) icon.  

After the route is started, in navigation mode you can always:

* stop your route by tapping ![](/assets/route_pause.png) icon, then **Stop movement** option from menu.  

* edit your route by tapping ![](/assets/route_pause.png) icon, then **Edit route** option from menu. 

* skip the next waypoint on your route and continue to the next one, or to your destination by tapping ![](/assets/route_rewind.png) icon:


<img src="/assets/waypoint_skip.png" width="375"/>

If you miss a turn or intentionally go the wrong way from the planned route, the App will automatically recalculate the route.




#### Voice instructions

When you’re navigating to a place, you can hear navigation directions. You can stop receiving directions at any time while in navigation mode by tapping the sound icon ![](/assets/sound_icon.png).

A long tap on the sound icon allows choosing one of the supported languages, which will be used for voice instructions. You can also change the language selection to hear the navigation instructions in the app Settings &gt; Navigation.
Read also: [Navigation Settings](03-settings.md#voiceSettings).

**Tip**: If you pair your iOS device with your Bluetooth capable device so you can stream voice instructions from the Guru app to your Helmet device or automobile speaker system. How it works: when listening to music the voice instructions would lower the music volume automatically and give directions and then would automatically go back to the normal volume of the music once voice instructions finished.

**Tip**: The best way to export several tracks at once is to save them in one collection and export the whole collection.



#### GPS Filtering

To **filter GPS data** and delete inaccurate points in the already recorded track, tap _GPS Filtering_:

<img src="/assets/track_gradient.png" width="375" height="667" />

**Note:** filters settings influence the appearance of track on a map and size of track while exporting, but they **do not** affect the number of recorded points. 

**Accuracy Threshold** 

Filter by the minimum accuracy of the received points. Points that are on the outside of the filter value will not be displayed in the track.

**Example**: You are recording your GPS track while walking around your neighborhood and you have entered a supermarket. Tall walls, roofs and other obstructions can block the signal from GPS satellites and the device cannot determine your location accurately enough. You may enable the accuracy filter to hide GPS points if they are too far from your location. If the received signal has lower than the required accuracy, that points will not be displayed in the track.

**Distance Threshold** 

Filter by the minimum distance between points of a recorded track. Points that are closer than the distance specified in the filter will not be displayed in the track.

**Example**: You are recording your GPS track while jogging, then you meet a friend and stop to talk to him. As the GPS sends location coordinates every second, too many points will be recorded on the same spot while you are talking and too many lines of a track will be drawn. You may enable the distance filter to hide GPS points if they are too close to each other and get rid of unnecessary lines.

**Note:** you can change gradient to show speed or altitude during the route by tapping button in the upper right corner. The point on the track is related to the speed and altitude values.

To set GPS filters for newly recorded and imported tracks, go to the app settings called [_Default Settings_](/03-settings.md#GpsFiltering).cds


## Collections {#collections}

Collections are groups of bookmarks and GPS tracks, like folders on your desktop. Organising items into collections makes it easy to keep your travel itineraries separate from each other.

#### My Collections List

To **create new collection**, tap the ![](/assets/plus.png) button at the bottom of the _My Collections_ list. Enter details, then tap Done.

To **view a set of bookmarks and GPS tracks** within the collection, tap the collection name in the list.

You can easily **sort collections** and its content by date created, distance and file name in the list:

* Recent — the most recently created items go first,
* Nearest — collections, containing locations that are the closest to your current location, are listed at the top,
* A-Z — items are sorted in alphabetical order.

To **search in the list**, tap the search field to reveal the onscreen keyboard and start typing. The list will dynamically display collections containing items that match your search criteria as you type.

To **delete from the list**, swipe left your finger horizontally across the collection, bookmark or track name you want to delete in _My Collections_ list, then tap the **Delete** icon.
