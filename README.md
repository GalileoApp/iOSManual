## What is Guru Maps? {#whatIsGuruMaps}

[Guru Maps](https://gurumaps.app) is a handy travel solution for offline browsing and [searching](02-features.md#search) the up-to-date map wherever you go. [Mark the places](02-features.md#bookmarks) and [record your trips](02-features.md#GPSTracks) easily in one tap and [organize your geodata into collections](02-features.md#collections) to easily access them later.

If you use more than one iOS/Android device, Guru Maps app will securely [sync all your data across multiple devices](03-settings.md#sync). There is also a [backup feature](03-settings.md#dataBackup) to save all of your information.
