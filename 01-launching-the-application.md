# Launching the Application {#launchingTheApplication}

## App permissions {#appPermissions}

On Android version 6.0 and higher you will need to grant some permissions during using Galileo.

### User location {#userLocation}

When launching the Galileo application on your device for the first time, you will see a message asking if it is allowed to access Location Services data. This is a standard request for permission that is generated by all programs that use location services.

* Tapping ALLOW will give the app permission to use Location Services to determine your current location on map if needed.
* Tapping DENY will prevent the app from accessing your location. You may allow location services access for Galileo at any time in system Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Galileo &gt; Permissions.

If you use Galileo feature, that require location services \(Such as [Tracking](02-features.md#GPSTracks) and [Routing](02-features.md#routingMode)\), you will see message asking you to enable it, if was disabled before.

* Tapping OK will continue your previous action.
* Tapping CANCEL will prevent the app from accessing your location. You may enable Location Services for Galileo at any time in system Settings &gt; Location

### Read & Write permissions {#readWritePermissions}

If you use Galileo feature, that require permission to read/write on your device storage \(Such as [Data backup](03-settings.md#dataBackup)\), you will see message asking you to enable it.

* Tapping ALLOW will continue your previous action.
* Tapping DENY will prevent the app from accessing your device storage. You may allow read/write permissions for Galileo at any time in system Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Galileo &gt; Permissions.

# Download a Map

When you allow the app to use your location, the app will ask you to download the map for your region when launching the app for the first time.

Other regions will be available for download while browsing and zooming directly on the map or from the app settings at [Download Maps](03-settings.md#downloadMaps) menu.

## Navigating a Map {#navigatingTheMap}

There are standard and well known gestures such as tap, drag and pinch which are used to interact with the app.  
To **move the map**, drag it with your finger in the direction you want to position the map:  
![](/assets/finger-moving.png)  
To **zoom in**, use double tap or pinch your thumb and finger apart:  
![](/assets/double-tap.png) ![](/assets/expanding.png)  
To **zoom out**, tap with two fingers or pinch your thumb and finger together:  
![](/assets/two-finger-tap.png) ![](/assets/reducing-size.png)  
Tip: to zoom in/out with only one finger, double-tap the map, hold the second tap and drag your finger up or down.  
To **zoom using on-map +/- buttons**, go to app [Settings &gt; Show Zoom Buttons](02-settings.md#showZoomButtons) to enable them.  
To **rotate the map**, hold the map with two fingers and drag them simultaneously in a circular motion.

Tap the map and hold to bring up the pop-up with available options \(from left to right\):  
1. Bookmark this location  
2. Mark your current location  
3. Get route directions to this location

To [measure the distance](02-features.md#measuringDistance) between two points as the crow flies, tap your starting and destination points with your fingers on the map and hold to trace the path. A dashed line will appear on the map between the two locations, and the estimated distance will then be displayed.

# Interface Overview {#interfaceOverview}

> This section will provide you information about basic usage and interactions in Galileo.

## Application Modes {#applicationModes}

### Location button {#locationButton}

The app works in multiple modes depending on number of taps on _Location_ button with the following sign ![](/assets/icon_gps.png). Your position is shown on the map as a blue marker when you are staying and as a blue arrow when you are moving:

![](/assets/map_location.png) ![](/assets/map_driving.png)

Tip: if your location cannot be determined precisely, a blue circle also appears around the location marker. The size of the circle depends on how accurately your location can be determined: the smaller the circle – the greater the accuracy.

### Tracking mode {#trackingMode}

To determine your current approximate location on the map and enable the **tracking mode**, tap once the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png)

Once tracking mode is active, app tracks your position on map as you move. To exit the tracking mode, move the map.

### Driving mode {#drivingMode}

To enable the **driving mode**, double tap the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas.png)

While in driving mode, the app will orient the map in the direction you are currently moving. If you stop moving, the map will be oriented by compass.

Note: the accuracy of the compass can be affected by magnetic or environmental interference \(e.g. the magnets in earbuds\) and compass may need to be calibrated from time to time. When the device displays the calibration alert, tilt the screen to move the red ball around in a circle.

### Location services {#locationServices}

Every time you see this icon ![](/assets/icon_question.png), it means that your GPS currently cannot get information about your location. It may also appear when Location Services is disabled on your device.

Note: depending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations.

## Trip Computer {#tripComputer}

Trip monitor panel provides you all the necessary trip statistics while moving. If enabled, it will display such useful information as \(from left to right\):

![](/assets/trip_monitor_1.png)

* current speed
* altitude

While recording a GPS track it will additionally display \(from left to right\):

![](/assets/trip_monitor_2.png)

* distance traveled
* trip duration

To hide trip monitor panel from map view, go to app Settings &gt; Show Trip Computer.
