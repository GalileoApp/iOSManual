# Launching the Application {#launchingTheApplication}

## App permissions {#appPermissions}

### User location {#userLocation}

When launching the Galileo application on your device for the first time, you will see a message asking to access Location Services data. This is a standard request for permission that is generated by all programs that use location services.

* Tapping **Only While Using the App** or **Always Allow** will give the App permission to use Location Services to determine your current location on a map if needed \(Highly Recommended\).
* Tapping **Don't Allow** will prevent the App from accessing your location.

**Note**: Galileo app depends on data services and location-based information might be unavailable, inaccurate, or incomplete unless you turn on Location Services.  
To turn Location Services on or off, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services.

### Notifications {#Notifications}

The App will also request permission to send you push notifications with the following system dialog. Tap **Allow** to be notified when new map updates are available.

## Download a Map {#MapDownload}

When you allow the Galileo to use your location, the App will ask you to download the map for your region when launching it for the first time:

<img src="/assets/download_map_1.png" width="375" height="303" />

* Download map - only an offline map will be downloaded

* Map with navigation data - in addition to a map navigation data will be downloaded as well (**required for an offline navigation**)

**Note:** after installation the size of map with navigation data will be more than during download (for example, the map of England with navigation data after installation will occupy 1759MB).

Other regions will be available for download while browsing and zooming directly on the map or from the app settings at **Download Maps** menu.

## Navigating a Map {#NavigatingAMap}

There are standard and well-known options such as tap, drag and pinch which are used to interact with the App.  
To **move the map**, drag it with your finger in the direction you want to position the map:

<img src="/assets/finger-moving.png" width="53" height="84" />

To **zoom in**, use double tap or spread your fingers apart:

<img src="/assets/double-tap.png" width="53" height="84" /> <img src="/assets/expanding.png" width="75" height="83" />

To **zoom out**, tap with two fingers or pinch your fingers together:

<img src="/assets/two-finger-tap.png" width="58" height="84" /> <img src="/assets/reducing-size.png" width="71" height="84" />

To **zoom in/out with only one finger**, double-tap the map, hold the second tap and drag your finger up or down.

To **zoom using on-map +/- buttons**, go to the app setting [Show Zoom Buttons](/03-settings.md#appearance) to enable them.

To **rotate the map**, hold the map with two fingers and drag them simultaneously in a circular motion. A compass icon will appear which you can tap to return the map to north-up:

<img src="/assets/hand_gesture.png" width="98" height="98" />

Tap the map and hold to bring up the pop-up with available options \(from left to right\):

* Bookmark this location, 
* Mark your current location,  
* Create route and directions to this location.

To measure the straight line distance between two points “as the crow flies”, tap your starting and destination points simultaneously with your fingers on the map and hold to trace the path. A dashed line will appear on the map between the two locations, and the estimated distance will then be displayed.

# Interface Overview {#interfaceOverview}

## Application Modes {#applicationModes}

### Location button {#locationButton}

The App works in multiple modes depending on the number of taps on the _Location_ button with the following sign ![](/assets/icon_gps.png). Your position is shown on the map as a blue marker where you are currently position and as a blue arrow when you are moving:

<img src="/assets/map_location.png" width="250" height="250" /> !<img src="/assets/map_driving.png" width="250" height="250" />

**Tip**: if your location cannot be determined precisely, a blue circle also appears around the location marker. The size of the circle depends on how accurately your location can be determined: the smaller the circle – the greater the accuracy.

### Tracking mode {#trackingMode}

To determine your current approximate location on the map and enable the **tracking mode**, tap once the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png)

Once tracking mode is active, the App tracks your position on the map as you move. To exit the tracking mode, move the map.

### Driving mode {#drivingMode}

To enable the **driving mode**, double tap the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas.png)

While in driving mode, the app will orient the map in the direction you are currently moving. If you stop moving, the map will be oriented by compass.

**Note**: the accuracy of the compass can be affected by magnetic or environmental interference \(e.g. the magnets in earbuds\) and the compass may need to be calibrated from time to time. When the device displays the calibration alert, rotate the screen to move the red ball around in a circle.

### Location services {#locationServices}

Every time you see this icon ![](/assets/icon_question.png), it means that your GPS cannot currently get accurate information about your location. It may also appear when Location Services is disabled on your device.

Enable Location Services on your device and give your permission to the Galileo app to determine your location in system Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services.

**Note**: depending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device will automatically determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations or even iBeacons any of which are in range \(These may vary in availability in more remote areas\).

## Trip Computer {#tripComputer}

The trip computer panel provides you all the necessary trip statistics while moving. If enabled, it will display such useful information as \(from left to right\):

<img src="/assets/trip_monitor_1.png" width="375" height="56" />

* current speed
* altitude

While recording a GPS track it will additionally display \(from left to right\):

<img src="/assets/trip_monitor_2.png" width="375" height="114" />

* distance traveled
* trip duration

To hide the trip computer panel from map view, go to app Settings &gt; Show Trip Computer.
